Aside from my academic and professional interests, I have a variety of hobbies and interests that I enjoy. I like to spend most of my time outdoors and especially enjoy rock climbing and hiking. Recently, I went on vacation with my family to hike for four days in Colorado. Below you will find some pictures from my trip.
