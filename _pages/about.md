Hi! I'm Kyle, an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at Fordham University. I recently successfully defended my Master's Thesis, which I completed under the guidance of [Dr. Ruhul Amin](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/research/faculty-research/research-consortium-on-disability/affiliates/ruhul-amin/) in the Fordham Human Centered AI Lab. I am also currently involved in new research at the Fordham Dependable and Secure Systems Lab under the direction of [Dr. Zakirul Alam Bhuiyan](https://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~bhuiyan/?_ga=2.28872252.1465687045.1661225584-1927066685.1661135573). 

My focus is on the responsible and reliable implementation of artificial intelligence. I am dedicated to ensuring that AI is robust, ethical, and reliable in all scenarios as we integrate it into our daily lives. With this goal in mind, I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science for Fall 2023, eager to further my research and contribute to AI's safe and trustworthy advancement.
