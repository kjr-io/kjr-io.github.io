Hi! I'm Kyle, a MSCS Candidate at Fordham University being advised by [Dr. Ruhul Amin](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/research/faculty-research/research-consortium-on-disability/affiliates/ruhul-amin/) as I complete my thesis in the Fordham Human Centered AI Lab. I have also recently initiated new research in the Fordham Dependable and Secure System Lab with [Dr. Zakirul Alam Bhuiyan](https://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~bhuiyan/?_ga=2.28872252.1465687045.1661225584-1927066685.1661135573).

How can we deliver on the promise of the benefits of artificial intelligence but address these scenarios that have life-critical consequences for people and society? Artificial intelligence controls the administration of insulin to help diabetics control their blood sugar levels, manages the candidate screening for the companies worldwide, and assists the judges in our courts to make more consistent rulings. The use cases of artificial intelligence are endless and are considered to be a major force in dealing with the challenges of the current Information Age. However, the more we integrate artificial intelligence into our society, the more important it becomes to guarantee: accuracy, robustness, fairness, and security. Inspired by solving these problems, I hope to see improvements in the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence across disciplines. With the above broad goals in mind that I am currently applying to pursue a PhD in Computer Science (Fall 2023).
