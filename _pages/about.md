As the Head of AI and Backend Engineering at Dune Security, I'm deeply involved in developing cutting-edge AI solutions that identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks within organizations. Our team specializes in leveraging advanced AI models to pinpoint potential risk factors associated with individuals in an organization and automate robust mitigation strategies. This proactive approach is essential in today's digital landscape, where the threat landscape is becoming increasingly sophisticated.

My research interests adversarial AI, cyberpsychology, and the security of AI systems. I'm particularly fascinated by the human factors in risk and how they intersect with the development of secure, distributed AI technologies. Staying aligned with state-of-the-art advancements in these areas, I continuously explore how to enhance the security and reliability of AI applications.

Before joining Dune Security, I was an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University, where I focused on teaching Python programming and its significance in modern computing and problem-solving.

I'm always interested in hearing about research ideas so please get in touch.
